# Who is using ink-tab ?

I created `ink-tab` at first to use in [changelog-view](https://github.com/jdeniau/changelog-view), a small cli to help you read what did change in your dependencies since your current version, reading CHANGELOG.md, HISTORY.md, github releases, etc.

If you use it in a component, feel free to tell me, I will be pleased !
